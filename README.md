## The RNG should consist of:

An input box to assign how many dice to roll
A drop down box to select the sides of the dice (for example d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)
A PHP rand(); function taking the inputs from the form
An output to show # of dice rolled, the type of dice (d4, d6 ..), the total count of the dices rolled
Output the details (number) of the individual dice rolls (Possibly using a foreach loop)
